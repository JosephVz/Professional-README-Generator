# Professional README Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

My motivation was to further my knowledge in using node.js. This is my first experience in doing some sort of programming so it is an interesting learning experience and isnt really that hard.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

I built this project to see what i could really do with one/two days of knowledge. I wanted to test out the uses of node.js and after creating this project i can fully see the uses of this program and future things it could be used for.

- What problem does it solve?

This solves the problem of writing the read me yourself. Instead of writing the readme hand by hand you could use this generator to give you prompts for each sections to easily fill out section.

- What did you learn?

I learned simply how to use node.js and how to install dependencies to use said node.js. This taught me more about java as a whole as its super similar to past projects we worked on and this really makes a lot of sense to me. There was a lot of things i learned in this project.
